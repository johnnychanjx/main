== Introduction

_EduBuddy_ is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing student profiles*. More importantly, _EduBuddy_ is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EduBuddy can get your student profile management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `EduBuddy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list` or `l`* : lists all students
* **`add` or `a`**`n/John Doe p/91234567 ic/S9315585J t/1A t/20 sub/English B3` : adds a student named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete` or `d`**`3` : deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduBuddy folder.

*Q*: What is L1R5? +
*A*: L1R5 is a grading system used in Singapore to determine the secondary school students' proficiency in the subjects taken for the O'Level Examinations.
The score is used for the students to enroll into Junior Colleges, which is the next higher level of education. "L1" refers to the first language subject taken by the student, while "R5" refers to the 5 relevant subjects that are examinable by the students.
The grade of L1R5 is then determined by taking the best grades of each category and summing them up, for example, if a student scores A1 for all 6 subjects are from each category, the score will be 6.

*Q*: How are the grades for the subjects determined? +
*A*: The level of achievement in each subject is indicated by the grade obtained, with A1 being the highest achievable grade and F9 the lowest:
